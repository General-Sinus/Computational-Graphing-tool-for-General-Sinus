  <h1>Computational & Graphing tool for General Sinus</h1>
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    The Graphing Tool for General Sinus is a Python application 
    built with the tkinter library that allows you to graphically 
    visualize and analyze trigonometric functions on a unit circle. 
    This open-source project of General Sinus has been developed in 
    response to the requests of our readers. We have received numerous 
    inquiries for a tool that can facilitate the exploration of 
    trigonometry concepts and their applications. As a result, 
    we are inviting the scientific community to join us in developing 
    this project as an open-source initiative.
  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>Our objective is twofold. Firstly, we aim to create a versatile Python library that provides comprehensive functionality for working with trigonometric functions, specifically tailored for the General Sinus application. This library will serve as a valuable resource for researchers, educators, and practitioners in various fields. Secondly, we aspire to develop a software tool that can streamline the utilization of General Sinus in the development of finite element methods and heat exchange simulations. By integrating General Sinus into these domains, we strive to enable users to achieve new results and insights, enhancing their understanding and application of trigonometry in practical scenarios.</p>
